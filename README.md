# F1 V6 with an FFT
Figured this could be interesting, maybe differentiate ICE/K/H activation, other drivetrain noises, etc... Turns out it's pretty hard to trace and it's mostly just various harmonics on the ICE (except 2022 ferrari's, in which case it's just the K). Haven't really looked into it more than that.
